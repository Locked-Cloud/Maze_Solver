Title:
Multi-Path Maze with A, DFS, BFS, and Greedy Algorithms* Description:
This maze is randomly generated with three exits and a player starting at a random location. The goal is to navigate through the maze using different pathfinding algorithms, including A* (A-star), Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Greedy algorithms. Each algorithm explores the maze in a unique way, providing different strategies for reaching the exits. The maze generation and player positioning are randomized, creating a fresh experience every time!
